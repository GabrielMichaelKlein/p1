# p1 - Problem Scenario

## Project Description

This Project involved solving a series of 6 problems which asked for information about a set of 6 different files. To accomplish this, the files had to be imported into a table which could be queried. To accomplish this, I connected IntelliJ to Spark to utilize Spark SQL as a quick querying tool.

## Technologies Used

* Scala - 2.11.12
* Hadoop - 3.2
* Spark - 3.1.2
* IntelliJ
* GitHub

## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Connects to Spark using Intellij
* Imports data from a CSV into a table using Spark SQL
* Combines data from multiple tables into one using Spark SQL

To-do list:
* Optimize performance for faster querying
* Allow for user-defined problems to be solved

## Getting Started

Follow the steps in the link below to set up IntelliJ for use with Spark:

Clone the repository onto your machine:

- git clone https://github.com/GabrielMichaelKlein/p1

In Intellij, run the program.

## Usage
